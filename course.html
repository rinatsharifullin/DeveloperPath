                            <h2>HTML</h2>
                            <img src="images/html-new.jpg" alt="wireframe">
                            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_html.asp">HTML</a> is first thing you learn. Without HTML impossible to learn other disciplines. This is base of webpage. On top of marked up code you can apply all other styling and scripts.
                                You will start from basic page creation on simple Windows notepad. Basic elements like &lt;p&gt;, &lt;H1&gt; to &lt;H6&gt;, &lt;a&gt; will be your friends for long time.
                                Then you learn useful HTML character entities like &copy; &reg; &lt; &gt; and so on.
                                After each theory information, you will be given practice sheets to replicate example or follow instruction to create some other constructions.

                            <h2>CSS</h2>
                            <img src="images/css.jpg" alt="laptop">
                            <p>In few weeks, you will start to learn <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">CSS3</a>. Both disciplines will be thought same time.

                            <img src="images/javascript.jpg" alt="laptop">
                            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_js.asp">JavaScript</a> is the programming language of HTML and the Web. Main purpose of this language is to manipulate of HTML elements and properties. You can easily validate form without sending to server. Or update all headers on some events. You can assign to buttons some functions. You can change colour and size on hovering of same element or other. This language opening big opportunity to make page more dynamic, interactive and attractive for users. For Java Script created many extensions, libraries to extend functions and make coding easy. One of the library you will learn is JQuery. Almost identical syntax but more powerful result.
